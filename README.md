# Meetup-RSVP-Automator #

Due to the popularity of a local basketball meetup in the Manchester area. Decided to take it in to my own hands on getting a spot for games every week, otherwise you have to manually logon and check for spots if some are taken.

At the moment the scripts will automate the whole process, and notify the user through email with a notification that there is a spot available to RSVP, and a Paypal redirect URL.

TODO:
* Automate the paying for process potentially using the Paypal SDK
  * Change the way it currently will notify the user.
    * If a spot re-opens
    * Time limit to the notifications (Don't want to bug the user every 5 minutes)
